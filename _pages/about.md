I am John Adams Villamoran, a dedicated and passionate researcher and science educator specializing in Physics. Committed to advancing scientific knowledge, I excel at creating a dynamic learning environment that inspires curiosity and critical thinking. My expertise include theoretical research and data analysis, with a strong commitment to continuous learning and academic excellence. My passion for groundbreaking discoveries drives my commitment to pushing the frontiers of knowledge in physics. I bring a deep understanding and enthusiasm for science and mathematics to both my research and teaching roles.

My research
======
My research interests encompass a variety of topics in gravity with applications to astrophysics and cosmology, as well as high-energy physics. Currently, I am working under the supervision of Prof. Yizen Chu at the NCU Fundamental Physics Theory Group at the National Central University, Center for High-Energy and High-Field Physics. Our group delves on the theoretical aspects of gravitational waves and neutrinos from cosmological sources, aiming to enhance our understanding of the universe through the exploration of these phenomena. Our approach primarily involves solving wave equations in curved spacetimes, such as deriving the Green's functions for linear differential operators.

During my master's studies, I had the privilege of working with the CMS Collaboration at CERN, where I analyzed data from proton-proton collisions at the LHC. I contributed to the search for rare Higgs boson decays into two leptons and a photon. My research focused on Higgs Dalitz decays, where both real and virtual photons are produced upon the Higgs bosonâ€™s decay. Additionally, I performed service work for the CMS collaboration, which included measurements of electron and photon reconstruction and identification efficiencies, as well as monitoring the data quality of the electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL) and preshower detectors.
